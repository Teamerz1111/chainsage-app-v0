## 🐦 Twitter Thread Template

### Thread Structure (8-10 tweets)

**Tweet 1 - Hook**
```
🚨 Just shipped 0g-Sygna to @0G_Builders mainnet! 

It's like having a security analyst watching the blockchain 24/7, powered by decentralized AI.

Here's what we built in 2 weeks 🧵👇

🔗 https://chainsage-app.vercel.app
```

**Tweet 2 - The Problem**
```
The problem: Blockchain explorers show you data, but don't tell you what it MEANS.

Is that transaction risky? Is this wallet suspicious? You're on your own.

We thought there had to be a better way.
```

**Tweet 3 - The Solution**
```
Enter 0g-Sygna: AI-powered blockchain intelligence.

✅ Real-time monitoring
✅ Automatic risk scoring
✅ Natural language explanations
✅ Instant alerts

All powered by @0G_Builders Compute Network 🧠
```

**Tweet 4 - Why 0G**
```
Why we chose 0G:

🔹 Decentralized AI (no single point of failure)
🔹 No rate limits (analyze unlimited transactions)
🔹 Wallet-based auth (no API keys to leak)
🔹 Cost-effective (way cheaper than centralized AI)

It was a no-brainer.
```

**Tweet 5 - Key Features**
```
What can you do with it?

📍 Monitor any wallet address
🤖 Get AI risk analysis on transactions
📊 Track patterns and anomalies
🔔 Real-time alerts for your watchlist

Try it: https://chainsage-app.vercel.app
```

**Tweet 6 - Tech Stack**
```
Built with:

Frontend: Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind
Backend: Node.js + Express + WebSocket
AI: 0G Compute Network (Llama 3.3 70B)
Deployment: Vercel + Render
Network: 0G Mainnet (Chain ID: 16661)

All open source 👉 https://github.com/Teamerz1111/chainsage-app-v0
```

**Tweet 7 - Building Journey**
```
The journey:

Week 1: Built core monitoring + AI integration
Week 2: Polished UI, deployed to mainnet, stress tested

Biggest challenge: Making AI analysis fast enough for real-time use

0G Compute Network made it possible ⚡
```

**Tweet 8 - Demo**
