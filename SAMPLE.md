- **Threshold:** $1,000 (default)
- **Expected Risk Score:** 75-90 (HIGH)
- **Expected Alerts:** Volume-based, pattern-based

### Medium Risk Testing
**Address:** `0x71660c4005ba85c37ccec55d0c4493e66fe775d3`
- **Threshold:** $10,000 (higher threshold)
- **Expected Risk Score:** 50-75 (MEDIUM)

### Low Risk Testing
**Address:** `0x2910543af39aba0cd09dbb2d50200b3e800a63d2`
- **Threshold:** $100,000 (very high threshold)
- **Expected Risk Score:** 25-50 (LOW-MEDIUM)
- **Expected Alerts:** Minimal alerts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Trigger Patterns

These addresses will likely trigger alerts due to:

1. **Large Volume Activity**
   - Exchange wallets process millions of dollars daily
   - Transactions often exceed monitoring thresholds
   - High frequency trading patterns

2. **Unusual Patterns**
   - Batch transactions (multiple large amounts)
   - Round-the-clock activity (24/7 operations)
   - Cross-chain movements between protocols

3. **AI Risk Factors**
   - Volume spikes during market volatility
   - Large withdrawal patterns
   - Mixing service characteristics
   - High-frequency micro-transactions

## üìã Usage Instructions

1. **Copy any address** from the list above
2. **Add to watchlist** through the Admin Dashboard Settings
3. **Set appropriate threshold** based on testing goals
4. **Monitor risk score** and alert generation
5. **Review alert patterns** in the monitoring dashboard

## üîí Important Notes

- These are **publicly documented** exchange addresses
- Used for **defensive monitoring** and **testing purposes** only
- Addresses are from official blockchain analytics sources
- Always verify addresses from official exchange documentation when possible
- Addresses may change over time as exchanges update their infrastructure
